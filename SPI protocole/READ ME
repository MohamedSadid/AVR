Using SPI protocol through Atmega32 with Temperature sensor TC72 that supports SPI protocol,
the control register of register of address (0x80) in the TC72 >> continous conversion (0x00)
then read the data from the high byte register of address (0x02)
Send 0xFF to push the data from the sensor to be received to the SPDR data register in the controller
at the end, display the result to PORTC through Blue LEDS
